---

## üìÑ `app.py` ‚Äî Main Entry Point

### Purpose

Runs the Streamlit app, sets layout, and routes to data exploration or CKD prediction.

### Key Functions

- `st.set_page_config()`: Set page title, icon, layout
- Tabs: 
  - **üìä Data Exploration**
  - **ü©∫ CKD Prediction**
- Initializes `CKDPredictor` class
- Checks if dataset is loaded before proceeding

---

## üìÑ `src/__init__.py`

### Purpose

Marks the `src/` directory as a Python module.

---

## üìÑ `src/utils.py`

### Function: `load_model_and_scaler()`

**What it does**:
- Loads `ckd_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`
- Checks if files exist
- Returns the model and scaler
- Cached using `@st.cache_resource` for performance

---

## üìÑ `src/predictor.py`

### Class: `CKDPredictor`

Main class that handles:
- Dataset loading & cleaning
- Data exploration
- Form input & prediction

---

### `__init__()`

- Loads model and scaler
- Reads dataset `Chronic_Kidney_Dsease_data.csv`
- Drops irrelevant columns
- Prepares clean DataFrame

---

### `prepare_data()`

- Drops missing rows
- Drops `PatientID`, `DoctorInCharge` columns if found (because in ML they are unasessary coloums)

---

### `data_analysis()`

Provides multiple interactive analysis options:

1. **Dataset Info**
   - Total samples
   - Total CKD cases

2. **Show Data Table**
   - Displays first 5 rows

3. **Class Distribution**
   - Pie chart of CKD vs No CKD

4. **Summary Statistics**
   - Shows `describe().T` of features

5. **Feature Distribution**
   - Boxplot by CKD status (selectable)

6. **Feature Importance**
   - Shows bar chart if model has `feature_importances_`

7. **Download Button**
   - Allows downloading cleaned dataset

---

### `form_inputs()`

Interactive patient form to collect 12 features:
Because these 12 features plays a major roll in CKD

- Age
- BMI
- SystolicBP
- DiastolicBP
- FastingBloodSugar
- HbA1c
- SerumCreatinine
- BUNLevels
- GFR
- ProteinInUrine
- HemoglobinLevels
- CholesterolTotal

### On submission:

- Scales inputs using loaded `StandardScaler`
- Predicts using `RandomForestClassifier`
- Shows result: CKD or No CKD
- Optionally shows model confidence

---

## üìÑ `models/train_model.py`

### Purpose

Train and save the CKD prediction model and scaler.

---

### Steps Performed

1. **Load Data**
   - `pandas.read_csv()`

2. **Data Prepareing**
   - Droping "PatientID" and "DoctorInCharge" (becuase they are useless in prediction)

3. **Target Column Cleanup**
   - Replace `CKD` with `1`, `Not CKD` with `0`



4. **Select Features**
   ```
   [
     "Age", "BMI", "SystolicBP", "DiastolicBP", "FastingBloodSugar",
     "HbA1c", "SerumCreatinine", "BUNLevels", "GFR", "ProteinInUrine",
     "HemoglobinLevels", "CholesterolTotal"
   ]
   ```
    Age: The age of the patients ranges from 20 to 90 years.
    
    BMI: Body Mass Index of the patients, ranging from 15 to 40.
    
    SystolicBP: Systolic blood pressure, ranging from 90 to 180 mmHg.
    
    DiastolicBP: Diastolic blood pressure, ranging from 60 to 120 mmHg.
    
    FastingBloodSugar: Fasting blood sugar levels, ranging from 70 to 200 mg/dL.
    
    HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c levels, ranging from 4.0% to 10.0%.
    
    SerumCreatinine: Serum creatinine levels, ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/dL.
    
    BUNLevels: Blood Urea Nitrogen levels, ranging from 5 to 50 mg/dL.
    
    GFR: Glomerular Filtration Rate, ranging from 15 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m¬≤.
    
    ProteinInUrine: Protein levels in urine, ranging from 0 to 5 g/day.
    
    HemoglobinLevels: Hemoglobin levels, ranging from 10 to 18 g/dL.

    CholesterolTotal: Total cholesterol levels, ranging from 150 to 300 mg/dL.


7. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80/20 split

8. **Standard Scaling**
   - StandardScaler transforms features to have:
    Mean = 0   
    Standard deviation = 1

Helps models learn better, especially when features vary in range.

1. **Train Model**
   - Random Forest Classifier
      -A Random Forest Classifier is trained with 100 trees.
         It's robust, handles both linear and non-linear data well, and is good for medical tasks.

2.  **Evaluate**
    - Accuracy and classification report

3.  **Save Artifacts**
    - `ckd_model.pkl`
    - `scaler.pkl`
